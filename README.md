# System-Integration-and-Architecture

I dont know much about this subject yet but when I searched about it, I found that it is about combining different systems like software, hardware and networks so they can work together. I want to understand how these parts connect to make one complete system because almost everything we use today depends on technology working together.

My expectation is to slowly build my understanding of this subject. I know it might be challenging but I want to learn the basic ideas and see how they are applied in real situations.

I also expect this subject to give me a clearer idea of how systems are connected and why they are important.
